Hello Frank Mutabazi,

I just wanted to send you a reminder that this is the last day to sign up to my new JavaScript Course. The launch window is about to close ‚è∞ and I don't want you to miss the chance to be mentored by me in learning JavaScript. Tomorrow the course will start with the first email.

Click here to sign up

I had a great response from the course so far, many people wrote me they can't wait to start receiving my course emails and having a successful launch is essential for me to continue creating tutorials and resources like my free handbooks - I couldn't dedicate to much time as I do otherwise!

So if you already bought the course, thank you so much. It means a lot to me as I can continue doing what I'm doing.

Even if you are not interested in it, thank you for your patience!

P.S. some people on corporate networks told me the site does not load correctly at the office. I am working with Cisco to fix the issue on their end, in the meantime if you get an error or warning try to access it from home or with a mobile data plan.
Have a nice day! <br>
